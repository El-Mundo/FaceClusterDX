The intro panel gives quick access to two options: [**load video**](#load-video) or [**load project**](#load-project).

### Load Project
A project is a file in **.fcproject** format generated by this application, which resumes the face-clustering networks created and edited by the user. A .fcproject file is manually generated by saving a project in the editor.

### Load Video
To start a new project, the user will have to select a video with the "load video" option. Directly supported formats are **.mp4** and **.mov**, but technically all formats compitable with the **AVFoundation** utility should be usable (tweaking might be necessary for esoteric formats, though).

Successful decoding of a video file will direct the user to the import setting page. It gives the user two import settings: **frame extraction interval** ("analyze every") and **frame scaling**. **Frame extraction interval** is used to reduce the number of the frames used for face recognition, which improves contrability and stability for large video processing. It also supports two units for deciding the interval: second and frame. **Frame scaling** decides if the analyzed frames should be scaled down to provide further acceleration.

## Editor

After loading a previous project or creating a new project with a video, the user will be navigated to the editor. The editor provides five panels for manipulating and interpreting the statistics generated by face recognition and clustering, including [**Network**](#network), [**Frames**](#Fframes), [**Overview**](#overview), [**Project**](#project), [**Timeline**](#timeline), plus [**a bottom toolbar**](#toolbar).

### Know Issues

Manually adding jpg and jpeg files with the same file name will result in unexpectable errors with face image identification. Using the import utility in the Frame view will avoid such issue by forcing all jpeg files to be imported as jpg format.

### To-dos

1. Improve T-SNE implement
2. Clean unused codes
3. Improve the stability of multi-network project editing
